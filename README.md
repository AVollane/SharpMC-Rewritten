# SharpMC-Rewritten
A rewritten version of SharpMC for Minecraft Java Edition 1.11 (No longer maintained)

This will mostlikely not be updated or supported by me (Kenny van Vulpen / https://github.com/kennyvv)
The reason for posting this is for anyone interested in writting a C# Minecraft server to look at or base off, if you are planning on updating this. Please do create a fork of this.
This is still missing a lot of functionality, this is up to you to implement if wanted.
